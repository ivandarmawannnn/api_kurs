Hai everyone

this is a api for get kurs from anything kurs to IDR

you can use in your localhost by this step
1. git clone to your code editor
2. run python app.py (make sure you have installed the required packages)
3. go to your localhost, 127.0.0.1:(your port)/get_kurs?date=yyyy-mm-dd&currency(example=USD)

I am very open to discussions regarding the code
